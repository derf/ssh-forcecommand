ssh-forcecommand - Whitelist remote commands via ssh config
-----------------------------------------------------------

* <http://derf.homelinux.org/projects/ssh-forcecommand/>


Dependencies
------------

 * perl version 5.10 or newer


Installation
------------

$ perl Build.PL
$ perl Build
$ sudo perl Build install

By default, ssh-forcecommand is installed as /usr/local/bin/ssh-forcecommand.
In most cases, this does not make sense.  For example, if you are using the
forcecommand for nagios checks, you might want to do this instead:

$ sudo perl Build install --install_path script=/usr/local/lib/nagios

Usage
-----

The documentation is available via "perldoc bin/ssh-forcecommand" or (after
installation) "man ssh-forcecommand".

Testing
-------

$ perl Build test

Requires the perl modules Test::Command, Test::Compile and Test::More.
